# Trees Tagger app and analysis software

## The vision of this project is to assist forest officials for trees census by tagging each tree with proper location (latitude and longitude), tree type, and other arguments. There is further plan to apply data analysis over the collected data.

### This project is basically based on:
* Flutter based app :  In this app, the user can tag the tree by locating or going to exact location and then feeding the latitude and longitude details along with the other parameters. Once the data is stored, it will generate a unique key and a QR code for the same, so that later on we can refer to that tree by that code itself.
* A data analysis system with Web App interface to the collected data and apply a machine learning model for prediction of different aspects.

### Problem it solves:
* Digital transformation for maintaining the record of forest trees.
* QR code generation for unique identification of every tree.
* Data storage, which can be maintained easily over cloud storage or even local storage.
* Can help in analysing the various aspects regarding trees; diversity, age, height, growth and much more.
* Predicting certain arguments on the basis of data collected.
