# Trees Tagger app and analysis software

## This project has the vision to assist the officials for Forest trees census and tagging each tree with proper location (latitude and longitude), tree type, and other arguments. and further had the plan to apply data analysis over-collected data.

### This project is basically based on:
* Flutter based app :  In this app user can tag the tree by locating or going to exact location and then feeding the latitude and longitude details along with the other parameters. once the data is stored it will generate unique key and an QR code for the same, So that further we could refer the tree by that Code only.
* An data analysis system with Web App interface on collected data and apply machine learning model for prediction over different aspect areas.

### Problem it solves:
* Digital transformation for maintaining the forest trees record.
* QR code generation for unique identification of every tree.
* Data stored and could be maintained easily over cloud storage or even local storage.
* Could help in annalysing the various aspects regarding trees, diversity, age, height,growth and much more.
* Predicting certain arguments on the basis of data collected.
